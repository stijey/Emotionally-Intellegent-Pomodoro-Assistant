# Affect Control Theory Pomodoro App

## A Productivity tool built on Affective Computing

Affective Computing is a subset of Artificial intelligence that deals with human emotion and computers. This application uses human emotional input to adjust the length of time a user spends working, taking breaks and the amount of work a user tries to accomplish in a period of time. This application based on the principles of the Pomodoro method of Productivity.
